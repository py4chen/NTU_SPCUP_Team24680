        ======
        
        Madmom is an audio signal processing library written in Python with a strong
        focus on music information retrieval (MIR) tasks.
        
        The library is internally used by the Department of Computational Perception,
        Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria (http://www.cp.jku.at) and the
        Austrian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence (OFAI), Vienna, Austria
        (http://www.ofai.at).
        
        Possible acronyms are:
        
        - Madmom Analyzes Digitized Music Of Musicians
        - Mostly Audio / Dominantly Music Oriented Modules
        
        It includes reference implementations for some music information retrieval
        algorithms, please see the `References`_ section.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Please do not try to install from the .zip files provided by GitHub. Rather
        install it from package (if you just want to use it) or source (if you plan to
        use it for development) by following the instructions below. Whichever variant
        you choose, please make sure that all prerequisites are installed.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        To install the ``madmom`` package, you must have either Python 2.7 or Python
        3.3 or newer and the following packages installed:
        
        - `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_
        - `scipy <http://www.scipy.org>`_
        - `cython <http://www.cython.org>`_
        - `nose <https://github.com/nose-devs/nose>`_ (to run the tests)
        
        If you need support for audio files other than ``.wav`` with a sample rate of
        44.1kHz and 16 bit depth, you need ``ffmpeg`` (``avconv`` on Ubuntu Linux has
        some decoding bugs, so we advise not to use it!).
        
        Please refer to the `requirements.txt <requirements.txt>`_ file for the minimum
        required versions and make sure that these modules are up to date, otherwise it
        can result in unexpected errors or false computations!
        
        Install from package
        --------------------
        
        The instructions given here should be used if you just want to install the
        package, e.g. to run the bundled programs or use some functionality for your
        own project. If you intend to change anything within the `madmom` package,
        please follow the steps in the next section.
        
        The easiest way to install the package is via ``pip`` from the `PyPI (Python
        Package Index) <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_::
        
            pip install madmom
        
        This includes the latest code and trained models and will install all
        dependencies automatically.
        
        You might need higher privileges (use su or sudo) to install the package, model
        files and scripts globally. Alternatively you can install the package locally
        (i.e. only for you) by adding the ``--user`` argument::
        
            pip install --user madmom
        
        This will also install the executable programs to a common place (e.g.
        ``/usr/local/bin``), which should be in your ``$PATH`` already. If you
        installed the package locally, the programs will be copied to a folder which
        might not be included in your ``$PATH`` (e.g. ``~/Library/Python/2.7/bin``
        on Mac OS X or ``~/.local/bin`` on Ubuntu Linux, ``pip`` will tell you). Thus
        the programs need to be called explicitely or you can add their install path
        to your ``$PATH`` environment variable::
        
            export PATH='path/to/scripts':$PATH
        
        Install from source
        -------------------
        
        If you plan to use the package as a developer, clone the Git repository::
        
            git clone --recursive https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom.git
        
        Since the pre-trained model/data files are not included in this repository but
        rather added as a Git submodule, you either have to clone the repo recursively.
        This is equivalent to these steps::
        
            git clone https://github.com/CPJKU/madmom.git
            cd madmom
            git submodule update --init --remote
        
        Then you can simply install the package in development mode::
        
            python setup.py develop --user
        
        To run the included tests::
        
            python setup.py test
        
        Upgrade of existing installations
        ---------------------------------
        
        To upgrade the package, please use the same mechanism (pip vs. source) as you
        did for installation. If you want to change from package to source, please
        uninstall the package first.
        
        Upgrade a package
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Simply upgrade the package via pip::
        
            pip install --upgrade madmom [--user]
        
        If some of the provided programs or models changed (please refer to the
        CHANGELOG) you should first uninstall the package and then reinstall::
        
            pip uninstall madmom
            pip install madmom [--user]
        
        Upgrade from source
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Simply pull the latest sources::
        
            git pull
        
        To update the models contained in the submodule::
        
            git submodule update
        
        If any of the ``.pyx`` or ``.pxd`` files changed, you have to recompile the
        modules with Cython::
        
            python setup.py build_ext --inplace
        
        Package structure
        -----------------
        
        The package has a very simple structure, divided into the following folders:
        
        `/bin <bin>`_
          this folder includes example programs (i.e. executable algorithms)
        `/docs <docs>`_
          package documentation
        `/madmom <madmom>`_
          the actual Python package
        `/madmom/audio <madmom/audio>`_
          low level features (e.g. audio file handling, STFT)
        `/madmom/evaluation <madmom/evaluation>`_
          evaluation code
        `/madmom/features <madmom/features>`_
          higher level features (e.g. onsets, beats)
        `/madmom/ml <madmom/ml>`_
          machine learning stuff (e.g. RNNs, HMMs)
        `/madmom/models <../../../madmom_models>`_
          pre-trained model/data files (see the License section)
        `/madmom/utils <madmom/utils>`_
          misc stuff (e.g. MIDI and general file handling)
        `/tests <tests>`_
          tests
        
        Executable programs
        -------------------
        
        The package includes executable programs in the `/bin <bin>`_ folder.
        If you installed the package, they were copied to a common place.
        
        All scripts can be run in different modes: in ``single`` file mode to process
        a single audio file and write the output to STDOUT or the given output file::
        
            SuperFlux single [-o OUTFILE] INFILE
        
        If multiple audio files should be processed, the scripts can also be run in
        ``batch`` mode to write the outputs to files with the given suffix::
        
            SuperFlux batch [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-s OUTPUT_SUFFIX] LIST OF INPUT FILES
        
        If no output directory is given, the program writes the output files to same
        location as the audio files.
        
        The ``pickle`` mode can be used to store the used parameters to be able to
        exactly reproduce experiments.
        
        Please note that the program itself as well as the modes have help messages::
        
            SuperFlux -h
        
            SuperFlux single -h
        
            SuperFlux batch -h
        
            SuperFlux pickle -h
        
        will give different help messages.
